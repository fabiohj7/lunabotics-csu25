There are two main methods of uploading code to the Pi Pico

1. Thonny
Thonny is a pre-installed IDE on Ubuntu for Pi,
it should automatically detect the board and connect to it,
it's pretty clunky to use, so it's not recommended.

2. ampy
ampy is a command to upload code to the Pico.
ampy --port /dev/ttyACM0 run <name of your script>
Make sure you are in the same folder as the script when running this.
If it doesn't work, the port may be wrong, use:
ls /dev | grep tty
And look for which path it may be under, it will stick out against the list/


NOTE: If the Pico does not have MicroPython installed,
see the pinned message in the #software channel of the Lunabotics discord for instructions.
