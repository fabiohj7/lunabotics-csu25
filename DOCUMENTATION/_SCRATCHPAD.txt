For scribbling down things quickly, once you're done tidy it up in proper documentation.

- Initializing rosdep for dependency management, required by usb_cam
- usb_can didn't work locally, didn't need rosdep at all

- Installed pip with apt, modified PATH in .bashrc for pip programs
- Added the lunabotics user to dialout for port access

- Created /etc/systemd/system/lunabotics.service and /usr/local/bin/lunabotics_ros_launch.sh

- Installed Astra, did everything here https://github.com/orbbec/ros2_astra_camera?utm_source=chatgpt.com
