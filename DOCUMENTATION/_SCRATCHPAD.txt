For scribbling down things quickly, once you're done tidy it up in proper documentation.

- Initializing rosdep for dependency management, required by usb_cam
- usb_can didn't work locally, didn't need rosdep at all

- Installed pip with apt, modified PATH in .bashrc for pip programs
- Added the lunabotics user to dialout for port access

- Created /etc/systemd/system/lunabotics.service and /usr/local/bin/lunabotics_ros_launch.sh

- Installed Astra, did everything here https://github.com/orbbec/ros2_astra_camera
- Also had to sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev

- Some dumb fucking bullshit service called motion hogs any camera plugged in after like 2 seconds and is for some reason only fucking visible to root so you have to run `sudo lsof /dev/video0` to even see it this shit took me several hours to debug who the fuck is going to turn their Pi into a security camera why does this shit exist. It is now uninstalled from the Pi.
